  "Black & Gray":
    "Shading is key when it comes to black and grey tattoos. Pieces in this aesthetic may include Realism, dotwork, linework, and more, but the use of grey shades of ink is essential. Here you’ll find inspiration from some of the best black and grey tattoo artists around the world.",

  Blackwork:
    "Black and bold is what makes Blackwork tattoos. Artists will specifically use only black ink, with the skin as negative space, to create striking pieces. Etching, engraving, dark art and illustrative are just some of the most popular Blackwork tattoo styles.",

  Chicano:
    "Often using black and grey and an illustrative, pen-drawn look, popular Chicano tattoos include low-riders, Payaso’s (crying clowns), as well as Catholic icons such as rosaries and Virgin Mary’s. Chicano tattoo art is an influential mainstay of the global tattoo community but has its base in Los Angeles and Mexican culture.",

  Dotwork:
    "Masses of tiny dots are used to create dotwork tattoos. Whether these dots are used for shading effects, or to create an entire image, the technique is called stippling. Perhaps the most popular in this aesthetic are dotwork mandalas.",

  Fineline:
    "Delicate and tiny linework is what makes up fine line tattoos. Relying on very small needle sizes to create their work, many minimal artists find fine line to be their favorite technique to use for their designs. The fine line tattoo style is perfect for those who want a powerful, but small, piece.",

  Geometric:
    "Geometric tattoos use shapes, lines, and patterns to embody this style. These tattoos can range from small, minimal patterns, to giant bodysuits, but always use forms of geometry in the design. Many pieces within this aesthetic are incredible sacred geometry tattoos.",

  "Hand-Poked":
    "Also called non-electric tattooing or stick and pokes, hand poke tattoos do away with the tattoo machine and are applied by repetitive tapping on the skin with a needle and ink. Hand poke is an ancient human practice, and the first tattoo technique ever used.",

  "Dark Art":
    "Terrifying horror films, master painters of the surrealist persuasion, and ancient evil alchemy are some of the inspirations behind the style of Dark Art. These pieces can range from Blackwork, Realism, and more, but if it makes you feel strange, it probably fits into this category.",

  Japanese:
    "One of the most iconic forms of tattooing in history, Japanese tattoos use design concepts selected from ancient folklore, and more, such as koi, dragons, and Buddhist deities. Gracefully forming the tattoo to the body is also a very important aspect of this iconic style traditionally called Irezumi.",

  Lettering:
    "Whether delicate script, or bold black gothic text, lettering tattoos are always based on the text and font that suits it, and the client, best. Cursive tattoo letters, Old English and graffiti all fit into tattoo lettering styles.",

  "Neo Traditional":
    "Neo Traditional tattoos blend the bold lines of Traditional tattoos with art forms such as realism, Art Nouveau, Art Deco, and more. Neo Traditional pieces are often very colorful, and may include ornamental elements such as pearls and filigree",

  "New School Americana":
    "Very bright, fun, and usually based in cartoon iconography, New School tattoos are usually colorful, bold, and include elements of design taken from animation and, at times, graffiti. Disney characters and famed anime icons are just some of the New School tattoo designs that you’ll see.",

  Realism:
    "Based on real life, still lifes, photos, and more, realistic tattoos is an incredible feat in artistry and design. Whether using color, or simple black and grey, Realism tattoo artists devote their time to creating tattoos that look highly realistic, and often 3D.",

  Illustrative:
    "As if drawings applied straight to the skin, illustrative tattoos often use linework as the main design element. Whether inspired by antique etchings, woodblocks, or simple sketches, Illustrative style tattoos look like pencil or pen has been used to create the piece.",

  "Classic Americana":
    "Traditional tattoos are immediately recognizable by their bold, clean black lines, limited color palettes as well as the Americana design motifs that include sailor iconography and pin-up girls. Old school tattoos are a classic mainstay of the tattoo community.",

  Tribal:
    "Tribal tattoos are based on ancient design elements including Polynesian patterns. Mostly using lines, dots, and black ink, tribal tattoo designs can be powerfully primitive and are often meant to emote the natural beginnings of tattooing and humankind.",

  Watercolor:
    "Painterly colorful pieces are created within the style of Watercolor tattoo. Usually used to depict flowers and fauna, watercolor tattoo artists are inspired by nature. Often they look exactly as if watercolor paint has been applied to the skin!",
